# XAI-Based-Strategic-Financial-Cutomer-Development


This library contains code developed for a strategic customer development decision-support tool based on explainable AI for financial applications. 

The code is primarily written in MATLAB, with certain components implemented in Python.

The Python segment focuses on applying various machine learning algorithms to the dataset. The model with the highest predictive performance is then chosen for explainability analysis using the SHAP method.

The MATLAB code implements counterfactual multi-objective optimization based on the prisoner's dilemma to determine decision-making strategies.
